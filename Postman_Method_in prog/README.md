# Coffee Shop ETL Pipeline

**Portfolio Project | Python + BigQuery**

Transforms raw transactional JSON data from a coffee shop into **analytics-ready datasets**:

- Cleans and normalizes inconsistent dates, times, quantities, and prices  
- Maps fields to match BigQuery schema (`item_name to item`, etc.)  
- Combines date + time into BigQuery timestamp  
- Generates **NDJSON output** ready for BigQuery ingestion  

**Skills Demonstrated:** Python scripting, ETL pipeline, data cleaning, NDJSON/BigQuery integration, data validation  

**Goal:** Shows end-to-end data engineering workflow using synthetic data for portfolio demonstration purposes.
